    <p>My name is John O'Neill, I have been in computing and Technology since the 1980's, my first computer was a Commodore 64 which I still have today, as a boy I used to write games in Assembly and even got one published in a magazine, I was very proud.</p>
    <p>I enjoy gardning, collecting vintage computers, and learning new things!</p>
